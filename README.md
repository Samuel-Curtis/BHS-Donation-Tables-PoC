# BHS Donation Tables Proof of Concept

## Live Demo:
https://samuel-curtis.github.io/BHS-Donation-Tables-PoC/

## Description:
This project is a proof-of-concept React + TypeScript app built with Vite to support the Bedford Humane Society, where I volunteer. I created this to learn React while exploring solutions for the Humane Society's fundraising efforts for their new Adoption Center. 

The application features a dynamic table component that displays donation options, split into different categories. This gives users the ability to directly fund parts of the upcoming Adoption Center. Users can click the buttons to choose which category they are interested in funding, which then updates the table's headers and data to show different donation opportunities. 

## Future Improvments
- Update styling to match the BHS color scheme and add appropriate whitespace
- Ensure the component meets accessibility standards 
- Add unit tests
